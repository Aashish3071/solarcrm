# SolarCRM

Solar CRM/ERP built from the client FRD (FR-001 – FR-044) and the Integration Booklet.
Design and plan: [`docs/`](docs/) (wireframes, traceability, workshop questions, FRD addendum). Architecture: [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

## Status

- **Phase:** 0 complete (foundations).
- **Progress:** monorepo, Postgres/Redis, login and role permissions, audit log, 23-stage workflow engine with server-side FRD rules, app shell with dashboard and project views. 31 unit tests and 3 end-to-end API tests pass.
- **Next step:** Phase 1, the working screens for Leads, Site Visits, Finalize & Advance and Payment verification (stages 1–9), then stages 10–20.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `packages/shared` | Domain rules shared by API and web: roles, module permissions, FRD §6 validations, the 23-stage workflow state machine. Pure TypeScript, unit-tested. |
| `apps/api` | NestJS + Prisma (PostgreSQL). Cookie JWT auth, role/module guard, row-level project scoping, audit log, stage-completion endpoints. |
| `apps/web` | Next.js app shell (dashboard, projects, project detail). Proxies `/api/*` to the API. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Local Postgres and Redis. |

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm infra:up
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env   # then set JWT_SECRET
pnpm build:shared
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev                                  # API :4000, web :3100
```

Seeded dev users (password `Solar@123`, dev only): `admin@`, `sales@`, `supervisor@`, `accounts@`, `office@`, `loan@`, `discom@`, `engineer@`, `store@`, `partner@` — all `@solarcrm.local`.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm --filter @solarcrm/shared test   # rules + state machine
pnpm --filter @solarcrm/api test      # end-to-end against the dev database (needs infra + seed)
pnpm typecheck
```

## Workflow model

Stages are a dependency graph, not a single status: after Project Initiated, Government Registration, Loan, DISCOM and Design open in parallel. Loan is skipped when not required. Every stage completion is checked server-side for prerequisites, the acting role, and the FRD rule for that stage (`packages/shared/src/workflow.ts`).

## Known interpretations to confirm with the client

- **24-hour visit rule (FR-005):** measured from supervisor assignment to the scheduled visit time.
- **Permission matrix (open point 13):** default derived from Booklet §3; ADMIN may complete any stage.
- **Object storage:** not yet provisioned; provider is open point 14.
